# Merge Requests

!!! info

    This section requires GitLab Premium (paid). (This is a GitLab's limitation, not GitLabForm's.)


These sections' purpose is to manage the project-Level Merge Requests **configuration** and **rules**.

## Configuration

The section `merge_requests_approvals` keys are as documented at GitLab's [project-level Merge Request approvals API, change configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_request_approvals.html#change-configuration).

Note that under it the deprecated key `approvals_before_merge` is NOT allowed in GitLabForm - please use the `approvals_required` field in the specific rules instead (see below.)

!!! note

    Some Merge Requests-related settings are also set in the [project settings](settings.md#project-settings).

## Rules

In the `merge_requests_approval_rules` section, key names are just any labels, except if the key name is `enforce` and is set to `true` - then only the rules defined here will remain in the project, all other will be deleted.

Under each key the contents are as documented at GitLab's [project-level Merge Request approvals API, create project-level rule](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_request_approvals.html#create-project-level-rule), but additionally, you may use these keys:

* `users` - an array of usernames,
* `groups` - an array of group/subgroup paths,
* `protected_branches` - an array of branch names.

...instead of the built-in keys `user_ids`, `group_ids`, `protected_branch_ids` which require you to provide the internal ids of these entities. 

!!! warning

    If any of the users or groups is not a member of the project, they cannot be approvers.
    However GitLab will NOT fail with an error in such case - it's will silently ignore these users and groups.
    This is GitLab's limitation, not GitLabForm's.

## Examples

Example 1 - a single approval rule where all the project members can approve, but no approval is required to merged the MR.

Note that `rule_type: any_approver` field makes it a special kind of rule where you don't have to reference specific users or groups. Also note that you can combine it with any number in `approvals_required` and any `name`.

```yaml
projects_and_groups:
  group_1/project_1:
    merge_requests_approvals:
      disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request: true
    merge_requests_approval_rules:
      any: # this is just a label
        approvals_required: 0
        name: "Any member"
        rule_type: any_approver
      enforce: true
```

Example 2 - a single approval rule that requires at least 2 approval from the following approvers: `user1`, `user2` and/or the members of the group `my-group` who will be called "Special approvers" in the GitLab's web UI:

```yaml
projects_and_groups:
  group_1/project_1:
    merge_requests_approvals:
      disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request: true
    merge_requests_approval_rules:
      default: # this is just a label
        approvals_required: 2
        name: "Special approvers"
        users:
          - user1
          - user2
        groups:
          - my-group
      enforce: true
```

Example 3 - two approval rules:

* one that requires at least 1 approval from any member of the `security-team` group, who will be called "Security Team" in the GitLab's web UI,
* second that requires at least 1 approval from any of the project members, who will be called "Any member" in the GitLab's web UI.

```yaml
projects_and_groups:
  group_1/project_1:
    merge_requests_approvals:
      disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request: true
    merge_requests_approval_rules:
      security: # this is just a label
        approvals_required: 1
        name: "Security Team"
        groups:
          - security-team
      any: # this is just a label
        approvals_required: 1
        name: "Any member"
        rule_type: any_approver
      enforce: true
```

Example 4 - two approval rules:

* one that requires at least 1 approval from `senior-sre-1` and/or `senior-sre-2`, who will be called "Senior SRE" in the GitLab's web UI, but this rule will apply only to MRs to the protected branches `production` and `staging`,
* second that requires at least 1 approval from any of the project members, who will be called "Any member" in the GitLab's web UI.

```yaml
projects_and_groups:
  group_1/project_1:
    merge_requests_approvals:
      disable_overriding_approvers_per_merge_request: true
    merge_requests_approval_rules:
      senior: # this is just a label
        approvals_required: 1
        name: "Senior SRE"
        users:
          - senior-sre-1
          - senior-sre-2
        protected_branches:
          - production
          - staging
      any: # this is just a label
        approvals_required: 1
        name: "Any member"
        rule_type: any_approver
      enforce: true
```
