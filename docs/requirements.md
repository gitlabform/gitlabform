# Requirements

* Python 3.12
    * you can use Docker image or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) if your OS does not have a required Python version
* Self-Hosted GitLab 14.4+ or SaaS GitLab @ gitlab.com
    * Premium (paid) license for some features
  
**Note 1:** GitLabForm is built and tested against [`gitlab-ee/latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-ee/tags), so some features may require a newer version.

**Note 2:** Some features may not be available in SaaS GitLab @ gitlab.com because of gitlab.com's limitations.
