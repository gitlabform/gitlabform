You can run it with a schedule on ALL_DEFINED or ALL projects to unify your GitLab configuration, after it may have drifted from the configuration. For example you may allow the users to reconfigure projects during their working hours but automate cleaning up the drift each night. An example .gitlab-ci.yml for running GitLabForm using GitLab CI is provided here: image : ghcr.io/gitlabform/gitlabform:latest some_project : only : changes : - config.yml script : gitlabform my-group/subgroup/project my_whole_other_group : only : changes : - other-config.yml script : gitlabform -c other-config.yml my_whole_other_group Note that as a standard best practice you should not put your GitLab access token in your config.yml (unless it is encrypted) for security reasons - please set it in the GITLAB_TOKEN environment variable instead. For GitLab CI a secure place to set it would be a Protected Variable in the project configuration . Running automatically for new projects \u00b6 (* - Why do we provide a how-to only for the new projects and not groups? Because we assume that there is no big need to automate configuring new groups as if you add a config for a new group to GitLabForm, then it's hard to forget to actually run it...) Using system hooks \u00b6 Probably all the methods to achieve this will use GitLab system hooks feature which makes GitLab perform HTTP POST request on - among other ones - these events: project_create project_rename - we want this because after the rename project may get a new config from GitLabForm, project_transfer - we want this because under a new group the project may get a new config from GitLabForm, Method 1: GitLabForm on the same server as GitLab + adnanh/webhook app \u00b6 In this method we assume that: you have GitLabForm installed on the same server as your GitLab instance. its binary is here: /opt/gitlabform/venv/bin/gitlabform . its config is in /opt/gitlabform/conf - config.yml plus some files for the files: sections. Step 1: Configure GitLab system hooks \u00b6 Go to https://gitlab.your-company.com/admin/hooks and create a hook with the URL http://127.0.0.1:9000/hooks/run-gitlabform . Uncheck all the extra triggers as the events that are interesting for us are among the standard ones. Leave \"Enable SSL verification\" unchecked as we are making calls over loopback, there is no need to encrypt the traffic here. Step 2: Configure the webhook app to run GitLabForm \u00b6 Get and install the adnanh/webhook app. Create this pretty self-explaining config: --- - id : run-gitlabform execute-command : \"/opt/gitlabform/venv/bin/gitlabform\" command-working-directory : \"/opt/gitlabform/conf\" pass-arguments-to-command : - source : payload name : path_with_namespace trigger-rule : match : type : regex regex : \"(project_create|project_rename|project_transfer)\" parameter : source : payload name : event_name ...and save it as hooks.yaml . Run webhook app with: ./webhook -hooks path/to/your/hooks.yaml -ip 127 .0.0.1 -verbose ...and keep it running. (In the long term you should make this permanent with a systemd service/other way appropriate to your distro.)

Please follow the upgrade guide for a fast and safe upgrade. New features/bugfixes: Subgroups now do inherit the settings from their groups. It should have worked like this already, but it did not because of a bug #372 fixed in PR #385 . (Please use inherit: false to keep the old behavior. See the upgrade guide for more info.), Shorter and easier to read errors (full stacktrace shown only when --debug is enabled), Backward-incompatible maintenance changes: Require GitLab version >= 14.4 (released in Oct 2021) as it contains the required API rename , Require Python version >= 3.7 (as 3.6 is EOL since Dec 2021) and update many dependencies that have required it, Drop support for a lot of deprecated configuration syntax that the app has warned about: branch protection - no more developers_can_push , developers_can_merge , use push_access_level , merge_access_level etc. instead, group members - no more group_shared_with , enforce_group_members , group_access_level , use group_members , group_members.enforce , group_access instead, services/integrations - no more recreate , Rename some configuration sections following the renames made in GitLab: services -> integrations , secret_variables -> variables , group_secret_variables -> group_variables , Drop the Debian-based Docker image (it's practically unused - you can maintain your own, if you needed it), (For users of this app as a library) Rename some API methods, remove deprecated ones: protect_branch() is now the method using the new API, the method using the old one has been removed, branch_code_owner_approval_required() -> set_branch_code_owner_approval_required() . delete_legacy_approvers() has been removed, all the methods with service(s) / secret_variable(s) / group_secret_variable(s) in their names have been renamed to contain integration(s) / variable(s) / group_variables(s) . Thanks to the contributors of this release: @ep-linden from Elastic Path . 2.12.0 \u00b6 Update base Docker images: from Python 3.9 and Alpine 3.14 to Python 3.10 and Alpine 3.16, from Python 3.9 and Debian 10 (Buster) to Python 3.10 and Debian 11 (Bullseye). Fix Group CI/CD Variables not honoring protected and masked values set to false . Fixes #384 . 2.11.1post3 \u00b6 Moved the project from gitlabform/gitlabform to gitlabform/gitlabform . Stopped publishing new images to the old egnyte/gitlabform Docker registry. 2.11.1 \u00b6 Fix another case of GitLab's Schedules API change/bug. Fixes #364 . 2.11.0 \u00b6 Allow breaking configuration inheritance . Implements #326 . PR #339 . Imagine you have a configuration like this: projects_and_groups : *my-group/* : *members : *enforce : true *groups : *regular-developers : *group_access : developer * *my-group/special-private-project : *members : *inherit : false # <--- the new keyword *enforce : true *groups : *special-developers : *group_access : developer *users : *john : *access_level : maintainer With the new inherit: false entry used here, the effective members for my-group/special-private-project project are ONLY the special-developers grup and john user. Always expect pagination for GETs. Fixes #354 . PR #358 . Workaround for the GitLab's Schedules API change/bug. Fixes #361 . Big thanks to the Elastic Path team for their contribution of the above feature, especially @ep-linden for the whole implementation and @amimas for the initial proposal and cooperation on design! (There were 4 pre-releases of this version, 2.11.0b1-b4. b1 contained \"Allow breaking configuration inheritance\", b2 also #358 , b3 also a fix of a bug that caused breaking config inheritance to not work in some cases, b4 - #361 ). 2.10.1 \u00b6 Fix a problem causing some changes to not be applied. Fixes #334 . PR #350 . 2.10.0 \u00b6 Deleting deploy keys is now possible . This partially implements #193 . Also completely replace the implementation of deploy keys, secret variables and group secret variables with a new universal one. This possibly fixes #19 . Up to 40% faster thanks to making less requests to GitLab. (For almost 1000 repositories the apply time has dropped from ~18 minutes to ~11 minutes.) With debug enabled a lot less duplication and a more readable output of dicts (shown as JSONs). For Contributors Introduce SingleEntityProcessor that generalizes editing things that are single per project, f.e. settings or push rules set. It does not edit entities if there are not changes to be applied. Using it implementing new features can be superfast! (See also MultipleEntitiesProcessor added in v2.2.0). For Contributors Faster tests and improved usage of fixtures. (A pre-release of 2.9.2 RC1 contained some of the above changes. 2.10.0rc1 pre-release was the same as 2.10.0 final but with a slightly different changelog - the speed gains turned out to be higher than expected.) 2.9.1 \u00b6 Fix version 2.9.0 not even starting. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Add test to prevent this from happening again. 2.9.0 \u00b6 Access level names (not only their numbers) are now accepted in the configuration . More strictness in parsing configuration YAML and better error messages thanks to a switch to different libraries. F.e. hash keys overwriting is not accepted anymore. Moved the project from egnyte/gitlabform to gitlabform/gitlabform and switch to GitHub Registry as the new main Docker registry. 2.8.1 \u00b6 Don't show \"Warning: Using group_shared_with: is deprecated\" although the user is not really using this config syntax. 2.8.0 \u00b6 Complete support for managing groups and projects members : Add enforcing (direct) project members - groups and users, including being able to remove all direct members and keep only the members inherited from the group. Implements #100 . Unify the configuration syntax for group and project level membership. \u2728 New \u2728 config syntax example: projects_and_groups : *foo/* : * # below key now includes what used to be under * # `group_shared_with` and `enforce_group_members` keys *group_members : * # there are only up to 3 direct keys below *groups : *another-group : * # below key's name been changed to the name used in projects `members` * # for groups (and the same as in the API to share group with group) *group_access : 30 *users : *my-user : *access_level : 50 # owner * # this will enforce group-level users to be ONLY as defined above *enforce : true * # this will make the projects in `foo` group not contain any **direct** users or groups other * # (so it will make it contain only the ones inherited from the group `foo`) *members : *enforce : true The \ud83c\udfda old and deprecated \ud83c\udfda syntax for a similar* config would be: projects_and_groups : *foo/* : *group_shared_with : *groups : *another-group : *group_access_level : 30 *group_members : *my-user : *access_level : 50 # owner *enforce_group_members : true * # !!! * - there was no enforce project members support before v2.8.0 !!! The old syntax works but will generate warnings. Support for it will be removed in one the future major GitLabForm versions. 2.7.1 \u00b6 Speed up running for ALL_DEFINED , when the defined groups and projects for just a small part of all the GitLab instance's groups and projects. Additionally always show the number of omitted groups and projects for any reasons (no config, archived, skipped). Fixes #285 . 2.7.0 \u00b6 Allow processing only requested configuration sections using a new cli argument -os / --only-sections . Minimize the number of unnecessary audit branch unprotect/protect events. Up to now every apply of the files section for protected branch resulted in unprotect and then (re)protect event for each protected branches and each file. Now this will only happen when the user running GitLabForm actually needs to do that, which should not happen often if you are using an admin account. Completely fixes #178 . 2.6.0 \u00b6 Complete support for Protected branches - access levels / users / groups allowed to push/merge/unprotect ( GitLab Premium (paid) only ). PR #289 . Add option to allow push force in protected branches . Implements #227 . Fix a bug causing the app to get HTTP 502 from GitLab when protecting branches in some cases. Fix getting members list to include usernames of all direct members not just the first page. PR #284 . Big thanks to the contributors of this release: @trissanen 2.5.0 \u00b6 Make commit messages for file operations configurable. Implements #278 . Thanks to @aleung for his contribution! 2.4.0 \u00b6 Add wildcard support for skip_groups and skip_projects . Implements #275 and #276 . Thanks to @chris-workingmouse for his contribution! 2.3.0 \u00b6 Add Protected branches - users allowed to push/merge ( GitLab Premium (paid) only ), PR #273 . For ALL_DEFINED also skip archived projects even if they are explicitly defined in the config, unless -a flag is added - for consistency. For Contributors Add docs for running the test themselves in a Docker container and for running GitLab in Docker using a license file, for testing paid-only features. Thanks to @florentio , @barryib and @Pigueiras for their contribution! 2.2.0 \u00b6 Add LDAP Group Links support ( GitLab Premium (paid) only ). Implements #140 . Add project and group badges support . Implements #59 . Allow 0 (no access) in Protected Tags. Fixes #172 . Exit on configuration missing projects_and_groups key. This will provide a helpful error message for typos made in this key. Fixes #242 . Make error messages more friendly when there is no network connection or when configuration is invalid (f.e. YAML parsing errors). Make the output of some processors a bit more consistent. Fix detecting an \"empty effective config\" and improve the UI related to processing groups and projects with such. Fixes #251 . Big refactoring that should make adding new features easier and faster. The main change is introducing a new way to implement \"processors\" - thanks to a generalized MultipleEntitiesProcessor class adding a new feature like Project Badges should is now as easy as implementing a class like BadgesProcessor and writing an acceptance test like TestBadges . Note that this new design may change in the near future and we are open to discussions and PRs to make it even better! We also plan to create a similar generalized SingleEntityProcessor class soon. Change the User Agent that the app uses when making requests to GitLab to a custom GitLabForm/<gitlabform_version> (python-requests/<requests_version>) . 2.1.2 \u00b6 Managing project members is not incredibly slow anymore. Fixes #240 Thanks to @andrewjw (Ocado Technology) for his contribution! 2.1.1 \u00b6 Fixed sharing group with a subgroup. Fixes #236 Improved re-protecting branches after updating files in them. Fail fast if the config is invalid. Better Docker images: Updated Alpine from 3.12 to 3.14, Started to build images in ARM64 architecture (apart from x86-64), Started to add tags , . . Note that Alpine-based image is the main one which gets these tags. For Debian-based images add \"-buster\" suffix. Implements #173 Thanks to @andrewjw (Ocado Technology) for his contribution! 2.1.0 \u00b6 Added a feature to share groups with other groups, with optional enforcing. Implements #150 Thanks to @andrewjw (Ocado Technology) for this contribution! 2.0.6 \u00b6 Fixed incorrect subgroups list when requesting to process ALL_DEFINED. Completes the fix for #221 2.0.5 \u00b6 Really fixed issue with unprotect_branch_new_api . Fixes #219 Fixed call to a Merge Requests Approvers API endpoint removed in GitLab 13.11.0. Fixes #220 Fixed potential security issue by enabling autoescaping when loading Jinja templates. (Bandit security tool issue B701 ) Thanks to @Pigueiras for his contribution! 2.0.4 \u00b6 Fixed issue with Push Rules when the project name contains a dot. Fixes #224 Fixed calling to process a single subgroup (like: gitlabform 'group/subgroup' ). Fixes #221 2.0.3 \u00b6 Fixed issue with dry-run for Project Push Rules when the current config is empty ( None ). Fixes #223 2.0.2 \u00b6 Fixed issue with unprotect_branch_new_api . Fixes #219 *(update: later it turned out that it was not really fixed in 2.0.2 but in 2.0.5 instead) 2.0.1 \u00b6 Fixed issues with Jinja loader. Fixed calls to GitLab API that do not contain 'x-total-pages' header (gradually rolled out since GitLab MR #23931 ). Start showing deprecation warning when using the old branch protection API config syntax. Thanks to @mkjmdski for his contribution! (2.0.0post1-3 release is technically the same as 2.0.1 but was incorrectly versioned.) 2.0.0 \u00b6 (For a detailed info about changes in each RC of v2 please see the previous version of this changelog.) Make deep merging of configuration actually work (breaking change). Fixes #197 (RC5) Introduce config versioning (breaking change). ...or rather a change to avoid breakage. New major releases of GitLabForm starting with v2 will look for config_version key in the config file. If it doesn't exist, or the version does not match expected then the app will exit to avoid applying unexpected configuration and allowing the user to update the configuration. (RC1) New config syntax (breaking change). All 3 levels under a common key projects_and_groups . It should contain a dict, where common config is under a special \"*\" key, group configs under keys like group/* and project configs under keys like group/project . This will allow introducing pattern matching in these keys and introducing support for multiple config files in the future releases. Partially implements #138 . (RC1) Exit with code != 0 when any group/project processing was failed (breaking change). This will allow you to notice problems when running the app from CI. Note that you can restore the old behaviour by running the app with (...) || true . Also standardized exit codes. Exit with 1 in case of input error (f.e. config file does not exist), with 2 in case of processing error (f.e. GitLab returns HTTP 500).Fixes #153 . (RC1) Allow any case in groups and projects names (breaking change). GitLab groups and projects names are case sensitive but you cannot create such entities that differ only in the case. There is also a distinction between a \"name\" and a \"path\" and they may differ in case... To make work with this easier GitLabForm now accepts any case for them in both config files as well as when provided as command line arguments. We also disallow such entities that differ only in case (f.e. group/* and GROUP/* ) to avoid ambiguity. Fixes #160 . (RC2) Ignore archived projects by default (breaking change). This makes processing faster and output shorter. You can restore the previous behavior by adding --include-archived-projects / -a command line switch. Note that you have to do it if you want to unarchive archived projects! Fixes #157 in (arguably) a more convenient way. (RC2) Color output! Implements #141 . (RC1) Add diffing feature for secret variables. (with values shown as hashes to protect the secrets from leaking). (RC6) Added checking for invalid syntax in \"members\" section. Defining groups or users directly under this key instead of under sub-keys \"users\" and \"groups\" will now trigger an immediate error. (RC5) Add support for Python 3.9 (RC8) Added Windows support. Fixes #206 (RC5) Start processing at any group using the new command line switch - --start-from-group / -sfg . Similar to --start-from / -sf switch that can be used for projects. (RC1) Start releasing pre-releases as Docker images. They have tags with specific versions, but not \"latest\" tag as it is reserved for new final releases. Implements #201 (RC5) Prevent multiple email notifications from being sent when adding members to project. Fixes #101 (RC6) Prevent project's Audit Events being filled in with \"Added protected branch\". Fixes #178 (RC6) Fixed using \"expires_at\" for users. Fixes #207 (RC6) Remove the need to add the gitlab.api_version configuration key. (RC1) For Contributors Make writing tests easier and the tests more robust. Deduplicate a lot of the boilerplate code, allow putting configs into the test methods and use pytest fixtures for easier setup and cleanup. This should fix issues with tests reported in #190 . Also stop storing any dockerized GitLab data permanently to avoid problems like #196 and probably other related to failed dockerized GitLab upgrades. (RC3) For Contributors Rename \"integration tests\" to \"acceptance tests\". Because they ARE in fact acceptance tests.

This article purpose is to explain \" specific how \"s - explain what is where in the code and how to add features by example. Project Structure \u00b6 Packages \u00b6 gitlabform.* and gitlabform.processors.* - contains the main app logic. It provides the CLI, parsing of the parameters, uses below two packages to apply the configuration to the requested set of projects and groups. gitlabform.gitlab.* - contains the GitLab API client code, grouped mostly by the GitLab API as documented at docs.gitlab.com . gitlabform.configuration.* - contains the logic for reading the config from YAML file or a string (the latter is only for testing) and getting an effective config per GitLab project by merging the config on these levels: common, group and project settings. Common pattern - multiple inheritance \u00b6 In many of the above packages we are using multiple inheritance . The basic features are implemented in the \"core\" class defined in core.py . Extensions to it are defined in all other files as \"feature\" classes that inherit the \"core\". Finally, there is an \"everything\" class that groups them all - it is defined in the __init__.py file. gitlabform. and gitlabform.processors. \u00b6 The entry point for running the app is in run.py and the main logic is in the GitLabForm class. This code boils down to the run() method, which for each project that according to the app parameters and config should be taken into account, applies the effective config. The effective config contains what is called the \"config sections\", which are the YAML keys that can exist under projects in the config YAML, for example: deploy_keys , variables , group_variables and so on. Those config sections are processed by the code in the classes inheriting from the AbstractProcessor class. This class should be reused when implementing new functionalities (such as supporting new configuration keys) as it holds the common logic for skipping the configuration parts and running in dry-run mode. The processors have been grouped into two packages - group where the processors applied to the group settings are implemented and project - where processors executed on the project level are located. Since v2.2.0 there is a new way of implementing processors - by inheriting form MultipleEntitiesProcessor class. It should be applied for new features which manage 0-N entities of some kind under a group or a project. See BadgesProcessor as an example how to use it. Since v2.10.0 we have a similar solution for features where you manage a single entity - SingleEntityProcessor class. See ProjectPushRulesProcessor as an example how to use it. Usage \u00b6 If you want to add/change/fix things under an existing config section then most likely you will need to update the code in the processor classes (for example, in BranchesProcessor ). If you want to add support for a new config section (= completely new feature), then you need to: (TODO: expand this sections) Consider writing a new processor using MultipleEntitiesProcessor or SingleEntityProcessor class as a base. Create a new class group_<new_config_section_name>_processor (if it applies to the group settings) or <new_config_section_name>_processor (if it applies to project settings) and implement two methods: _process_configuration - which does the actual processing by calling the API and applying the changes in GitLab; _log_changes - which is optional but recommended to implement; by calling this method the effective changes to be applied should be logged (when running in dry-run mode). Add the new processor to GroupProcessors in group > __init__.py (if group settings processor was created) or to ProjectProcessors in project > __init__.py . gitlabform.gitlab.* \u00b6 With the basics for making requests to the GitLab API covered in the GitLabCore class in core.py , all other code is simple (most of the time). Almost all methods in other classes end up calling self._make_requests_to_api , which takes care of making the HTTP GitLab API requests with proper authentication, pagination, retries, timeouts and more. Sometimes there is some logic in these methods if: we only need a specific part of the response from GitLab API - see GitLabProjects.get_all_projects() as an example, some GitLab APIs need some workarounds for their bugs or documentation inconsistencies, like: some APIs declare in the docs that they accept both \"group/project\" string OR a project id while in fact only the latter works - see GitLabProjects.post_approvals() as an example, some APIs return invalid HTTP error codes, like 404 instead of 400 - see GitLabGroupLDAPLinks.add_ldap_group_link as an example. Note : Some of the code here is NOT used by the GitLabForm app , but utilized by internal Egnyte applications that have not (yet) switched to the more standard python-gitlab . Usage \u00b6 If you want to add/change/fix code that operates on an existing GitLab API you should look around the \"feature\" classes in this package (for example GitLabMergeRequests in merge_requests.py ). If you want to add code that operates on the new GitLab API you should: create a new new_gitlab_api_name.py file in gitlabform.gitlab and define a \"feature\" class there that inherits GitLabCore (for example: GitLabApiName ). add the new feature class to the list of classes inherited by the \"everything\" GitLab class defined in __init__.py . gitlabform.configuration.* \u00b6 TODO : describe this part.

Projects and groups configuration \u00b6 Configuration hierarchy \u00b6 In GitLabForm you define the configuration for your groups and projects under the projects_and_groups: top-level key, on 3 levels: Level name Key syntax Description common \"*\" the configuration that will be applied to all projects and all groups group/subgroup group/* , group/subgroup/* the configuration that will be applied to everything under a given group/subgroup, recursively (so the group/subgroup itself, all the projects in it, all the subgroups in it and all the projects in the subgroups in it) project group/project , group/subgroup/project the configuration for specific single projects Each level is optional. Order does not matter. Example: # (...) - other mandatory top-level keys projects_and_groups : \"*\" : # common-level config group_1/* : # group-level config group_1/project_1 : # project-level config group_1/project_2 : # project-level config group_1/project_3 : # project-level config group_2/* : # group-level config group_2/project_1 : # project-level config group_2/subgroup/* : # subgroup-level config group_2/subgroup/nested_project_1 : # project-level config Configuration sections \u00b6 Under each of the keys described above, we put configuration to apply for given entities. These keys are called \"sections\" within this app. Some configuration sections apply only to projects , some to groups . Syntax for each section is explained in detail on subpages - see links on the left. Effective configuration \u00b6 To generate the effective configuration to apply for a given project or group, if it is configured on more than one level, GitLabForm will merge those configurations. If there are conflicting values in the more general (f.e. common) and more specific level (f.e. group level), then the more specific configuration will overwrite the more general one. Example: projects_and_groups : # common settings for ALL projects in ALL groups \"*\" : project_settings : default_branch : main visibility : internal group_1/* : project_settings : visibility : private For this configuration, for a project group_1/project_1 the effective project settings will be: default_branch: main , visibility: private . If the keys are added under different names in the more general and the more specific config, then they are added . So for example for sections like deploy_keys , variables , hooks on each lower level the effective configuration will contain elements from the higher levels plus elements from the lower levels. Example: projects_and_groups : \"*\" : deploy_keys : a_shared_key : key : ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDB2QKx6BPzL... title : global_key can_push : false group_1/* : deploy_keys : another_key : key : ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDtbyEK66RXg... title : group_key can_push : false For this configuration, for a project group_1/project_1 the effective configuration will contain 2 keys, a_shared_key and another_key . Skipping sections \u00b6 If the only key under a section is skip: true then the given config section is not set AT ALL for a given entity. Example: projects_and_groups : \"*\" : deploy_keys : a_shared_key : key : ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDB2QKx6BPzL... title : global_key can_push : false group_1/* : deploy_keys : skip : true For the above configuration, for a project group_1/project_1 the effective configuration is to NOT manage the deploy keys at all. Important skip: true can be placed ONLY directly under a section name. Breaking inheritance \u00b6 You can prevent inheriting configuration from the higher levels by placing inherit: false under a given section. Example: projects_and_groups : \"*\" : deploy_keys : a_shared_key : key : ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDB2QKx6BPzL... title : global_key # this name is show in GitLab can_push : false group_1/* : deploy_keys : inherit : false another_key : key : ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDtbyEK66RXg... title : group_key # this name is show in GitLab can_push : false For the above configuration, for a project group_1/project_1 the effective configuration will contain only 1 key - the another_key . Important inherit: false can be placed at ANY place in the configuration (if it makes sense). Raw parameters passing \u00b6 Some configuration sections, f.e. project_settings , will be directly send by the app via the API to specific GitLab API endpoints. This means that they key names and values are exactly like they are described in the appropriate API docs. These sections are appropriately marked in the reference docs. The advantages of this approach: you can use all the parameters from the API - for the project_settings it is over 40 parameters as of now (see the GitLab API for Projects ) while for group_settings - it is over 20 parameters (see the GitLab API for Groups ), whenever GitLab adds a new feature to its API and you upgrade your GitLab instance, the feature is immediately configurable with GitLabForm, without updating this app, The disadvantages: you have to read the appropriate GitLab API docs when you create your initial config for some entities, like Projects or Groups, if GitLab changes something in their API syntax, you will have to apply the change in your config too - there is no abstraction layer that will protect you from it. Optional top-level keys \u00b6 The configuration can, but doesn't have to contain the following top-level keys: # list of projects that will not be processed skip_projects : - my-group/this-project-will-not-be-processed-with-gitlabform - my-group/and-this-project0too - my-group/everything-under/* # list of groups that will not be processed skip_groups : - my-other-group - this-group-and-all-sub-groups/*","title":"Configuration reference"},{"location":"reference/#configuration-reference","text":"The whole configuration for the app needs to be in a single YAML file of any name.
