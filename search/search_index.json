Fixes #197 (RC5)</p> </li> <li> <p>Introduce config versioning (breaking change). ...or rather a change to avoid breakage. New major releases of GitLabForm starting with v2 will look for <code>config_version</code> key in the config file. If it doesn't exist, or the version does not match expected then the app will exit to avoid applying unexpected configuration and allowing the user to update the configuration. (RC1)</p> </li> <li> <p>New config syntax (breaking change). All 3 levels under a common key <code>projects_and_groups</code>. It should contain a dict, where common config is under a special <code>\"*\"</code> key, group configs under keys like <code>group/*</code> and project configs under keys like <code>group/project</code>. This will allow introducing pattern matching in these keys and introducing support for multiple config files in the future releases. Partially implements #138. (RC1)</p> </li> <li> <p>Exit with code != 0 when any group/project processing was failed (breaking change). This will allow you to notice problems when running the app from CI. Note that you can restore the old behaviour by running the app with <code>(...) || true</code>. Also standardized exit codes. Exit with 1 in case of input error (f.e. config file does not exist), with 2 in case of processing error (f.e. GitLab returns HTTP 500).Fixes #153. (RC1)</p> </li> <li> <p>Allow any case in groups and projects names (breaking change). GitLab groups and projects names are case sensitive but you cannot create such entities that differ only in the case. There is also a distinction between a \"name\" and a \"path\" and they may differ in case... To make work with this easier GitLabForm now accepts any case for them in both config files as well as when provided as command line arguments. We also disallow such entities that differ only in case (f.e. <code>group/*</code> and <code>GROUP/*</code>) to avoid ambiguity. Fixes #160. (RC2)</p> </li> <li> <p>Ignore archived projects by default (breaking change). This makes processing faster and output shorter. You can restore the previous behavior by adding <code>--include-archived-projects</code>/<code>-a</code> command line switch. Note that you have to do it if you want to unarchive archived projects! Fixes #157 in (arguably) a more convenient way. (RC2)</p> </li> <li> <p>Color output! Implements #141. (RC1)</p> </li> <li> <p>Add diffing feature for secret variables. (with values shown as hashes to protect the secrets from leaking). (RC6)</p> </li> <li> <p>Added checking for invalid syntax in \"members\" section. Defining groups or users directly under this key instead of under sub-keys \"users\" and \"groups\" will now trigger an immediate error. (RC5)</p> </li> <li> <p>Add support for Python 3.9 (RC8)</p> </li> <li> <p>Added Windows support. Fixes #206 (RC5)</p> </li> <li> <p>Start processing at any group using the new command line switch - <code>--start-from-group</code>/<code>-sfg</code>. Similar to <code>--start-from</code>/<code>-sf</code> switch that can be used for projects. (RC1)</p> </li> <li> <p>Start releasing pre-releases as Docker images. They have tags with specific versions, but not \"latest\" tag as it is reserved for new final releases. Implements #201 (RC5)</p> </li> <li> <p>Prevent multiple email notifications from being sent when adding members to project. Fixes #101 (RC6)</p> </li> <li> <p>Prevent project's Audit Events being filled in with \"Added protected branch\". Fixes #178 (RC6)</p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed using \"expires_at\" for users. Fixes #207 (RC6)</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove the need to add the <code>gitlab.api_version</code> configuration key. (RC1)</p> </li> <li> <p>For Contributors Make writing tests easier and the tests more robust. Deduplicate a lot of the boilerplate code, allow putting configs into the test methods and use pytest fixtures for easier setup and cleanup. This should fix issues with tests reported in #190. Also stop storing any dockerized GitLab data permanently to avoid problems like #196 and probably other related to failed dockerized GitLab upgrades. (RC3)</p> </li> <li> <p>For Contributors Rename \"integration tests\" to \"acceptance tests\". Because they ARE in fact acceptance tests.

GLF allows configuring everything it supports for ALL of your projects   in your GitLab instance (with the possibility to provide more specialized configuration for some of the groups and projects).</p> </li> <li> <p>GT is using a structured language which describes each managed resource explicitly (with iterators, of course) while   GLF is based on YAML and a concept of hierarchical, inheritable configuration with merging/overwriting and addivity.   Therefore only with GLF you can write configs like \"For all projects in group X do this, but for specific projects X/A   and X/B in it also do this and for X/C do something a bit different\".</p> </li> <li> <p>GT wraps the GitLab API into abstractions while GLF in many cases (explained in the docs) makes PUT/POST requests of the dicts found   in the config as-is to the GitLab API. GT approach is more convenient and less \"raw\" (you read GT docs when using it, while   for GLF you also have to read GitLab API docs) but GLF allows you to use all of the GitLab API features - GT supports only   a fraction of GitLab's API parameters for editing group and project while GLF by design allows you to use all of them.
