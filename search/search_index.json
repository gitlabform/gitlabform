You can run it with a schedule on ALL_DEFINED or ALL projects to unify your GitLab configuration, after it may have drifted from the configuration. For example you may allow the users to reconfigure projects during their working hours but automate cleaning up the drift each night. An example .gitlab-ci.yml for running GitLabForm using GitLab CI is provided here: image : ghcr.io/gdubicki/gitlabform:latest some_project : only : changes : - config.yml script : gitlabform my-group/subgroup/project my_whole_other_group : only : changes : - other-config.yml script : gitlabform -c other-config.yml my_whole_other_group Note that as a standard best practice you should not put your GitLab access token in your config.yml (unless it is encrypted) for security reasons - please set it in the GITLAB_TOKEN environment variable instead.

Because we assume that there is no big need to automate configuring new groups as if you add a config for a new group to GitLabForm, then it's hard to forget to actually run it...) Using system hooks \u00b6 Probably all the methods to achieve this will use GitLab system hooks feature which makes GitLab perform HTTP POST request on - among other ones - these events: project_create project_rename - we want this because after the rename project may get a new config from GitLabForm, project_transfer - we want this because under a new group the project may get a new config from GitLabForm, Method 1: GitLabForm on the same server as GitLab + adnanh/webhook app \u00b6 In this method we assume that: you have GitLabForm installed on the same server as your GitLab instance. its binary is here: /opt/gitlabform/venv/bin/gitlabform . its config is in /opt/gitlabform/conf - config.yml plus some files for the files: sections. Step 1: Configure GitLab system hooks \u00b6 Go to https://gitlab.your-company.com/admin/hooks and create a hook with the URL http://127.0.0.1:9000/hooks/run-gitlabform .

(There were 4 pre-releases of this version, 2.11.0b1-b4. b1 contained \"Allow breaking configuration inheritance\", b2 also #358 , b3 also a fix of a bug that caused breaking config inheritance to not work in some cases, b4 - #361 ). 2.10.1 \u00b6 Fix a problem causing some changes to not be applied. Fixes #334 . PR #350 . 2.10.0 \u00b6 Deleting deploy keys is now possible . This partially implements #193 . Also completely replace the implementation of deploy keys, secret variables and group secret variables with a new universal one. This possibly fixes #19 . Up to 40% faster thanks to making less requests to GitLab. (For almost 1000 repositories the apply time has dropped from ~18 minutes to ~11 minutes.) With debug enabled a lot less duplication and a more readable output of dicts (shown as JSONs). For Contributors Introduce SingleEntityProcessor that generalizes editing things that are single per project, f.e. settings or push rules set. It does not edit entities if there are not changes to be applied. Using it implementing new features can be superfast! (See also MultipleEntitiesProcessor added in v2.2.0). For Contributors Faster tests and improved usage of fixtures. (A pre-release of 2.9.2 RC1 contained some of the above changes. 2.10.0rc1 pre-release was the same as 2.10.0 final but with a slightly different changelog - the speed gains turned out to be higher than expected.) 2.9.1 \u00b6 Fix version 2.9.0 not even starting. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Add test to prevent this from happening again. 2.9.0 \u00b6 Access level names (not only their numbers) are now accepted in the configuration . More strictness in parsing configuration YAML and better error messages thanks to a switch to different libraries. F.e. hash keys overwriting is not accepted anymore. Moved the project from egnyte/gitlabform to gdubicki/gitlabform and switch to GitHub Registry as the new main Docker registry. 2.8.1 \u00b6 Don't show \"Warning: Using group_shared_with: is deprecated\" although the user is not really using this config syntax. 2.8.0 \u00b6 Complete support for managing groups and projects members : Add enforcing (direct) project members - groups and users, including being able to remove all direct members and keep only the members inherited from the group. Implements #100 . Unify the configuration syntax for group and project level membership. \u2728 New \u2728 config syntax example: projects_and_groups : foo/* : # below key now includes what used to be under # `group_shared_with` and `enforce_group_members` keys group_members : # there are only up to 3 direct keys below groups : another-group : # below key's name been changed to the name used in projects `members` # for groups (and the same as in the API to share group with group) group_access : 30 users : my-user : access_level : 50 # owner # this will enforce group-level users to be ONLY as defined above enforce : true # this will make the projects in `foo` group not contain any **direct** users or groups other # (so it will make it contain only the ones inherited from the group `foo`) members : enforce : true The \ud83c\udfda old and deprecated \ud83c\udfda syntax for a similar* config would be: projects_and_groups : foo/* : group_shared_with : groups : another-group : group_access_level : 30 group_members : my-user : access_level : 50 # owner enforce_group_members : true # !!! * - there was no enforce project members support before v2.8.0 !!! The old syntax works but will generate warnings. Support for it will be removed in one the future major GitLabForm versions. 2.7.1 \u00b6 Speed up running for ALL_DEFINED , when the defined groups and projects for just a small part of all the GitLab instance's groups and projects. Additionally always show the number of omitted groups and projects for any reasons (no config, archived, skipped). Fixes #285 . 2.7.0 \u00b6 Allow processing only requested configuration sections using a new cli argument -os / --only-sections . Minimize the number of unnecessary audit branch unprotect/protect events. Up to now every apply of the files section for protected branch resulted in unprotect and then (re)protect event for each protected branches and each file. Now this will only happen when the user running GitLabForm actually needs to do that, which should not happen often if you are using an admin account. Completely fixes #178 . 2.6.0 \u00b6 Complete support for Protected branches - access levels / users / groups allowed to push/merge/unprotect ( GitLab Premium (paid) only ). PR #289 . Add option to allow push force in protected branches . Implements #227 . Fix a bug causing the app to get HTTP 502 from GitLab when protecting branches in some cases. Fix getting members list to include usernames of all direct members not just the first page. PR #284 . Big thanks to the contributors of this release: @trissanen 2.5.0 \u00b6 Make commit messages for file operations configurable. Implements #278 . Thanks to @aleung for his contribution! 2.4.0 \u00b6 Add wildcard support for skip_groups and skip_projects . Implements #275 and #276 . Thanks to @chris-workingmouse for his contribution! 2.3.0 \u00b6 Add Protected branches - users allowed to push/merge ( GitLab Premium (paid) only ), PR #273 . For ALL_DEFINED also skip archived projects even if they are explicitly defined in the config, unless -a flag is added - for consistency. For Contributors Add docs for running the test themselves in a Docker container and for running GitLab in Docker using a license file, for testing paid-only features. Thanks to @florentio , @barryib and @Pigueiras for their contribution! 2.2.0 \u00b6 Add LDAP Group Links support ( GitLab Premium (paid) only ). Implements #140 . Add project and group badges support . Implements #59 . Allow 0 (no access) in Protected Tags. Fixes #172 . Exit on configuration missing projects_and_groups key. This will provide a helpful error message for typos made in this key. Fixes #242 . Make error messages more friendly when there is no network connection or when configuration is invalid (f.e. YAML parsing errors). Make the output of some processors a bit more consistent. Fix detecting an \"empty effective config\" and improve the UI related to processing groups and projects with such. Fixes #251 . Big refactoring that should make adding new features easier and faster. The main change is introducing a new way to implement \"processors\" - thanks to a generalized MultipleEntitiesProcessor class adding a new feature like Project Badges should is now as easy as implementing a class like BadgesProcessor and writing an acceptance test like TestBadges . Note that this new design may change in the near future and we are open to discussions and PRs to make it even better! We also plan to create a similar generalized SingleEntityProcessor class soon. Change the User Agent that the app uses when making requests to GitLab to a custom GitLabForm/<gitlabform_version> (python-requests/<requests_version>) . 2.1.2 \u00b6 Managing project members is not incredibly slow anymore. Fixes #240 Thanks to @andrewjw (Ocado Technology) for his contribution! 2.1.1 \u00b6 Fixed sharing group with a subgroup. Fixes #236 Improved re-protecting branches after updating files in them. Fail fast if the config is invalid. Better Docker images: Updated Alpine from 3.12 to 3.14, Started to build images in ARM64 architecture (apart from x86-64), Started to add tags , . . Note that Alpine-based image is the main one which gets these tags. For Debian-based images add \"-buster\" suffix. Implements #173 Thanks to @andrewjw (Ocado Technology) for his contribution! 2.1.0 \u00b6 Added a feature to share groups with other groups, with optional enforcing. Implements #150 Thanks to @andrewjw (Ocado Technology) for this contribution! 2.0.6 \u00b6 Fixed incorrect subgroups list when requesting to process ALL_DEFINED. Completes the fix for #221 2.0.5 \u00b6 Really fixed issue with unprotect_branch_new_api . Fixes #219 Fixed call to a Merge Requests Approvers API endpoint removed in GitLab 13.11.0. Fixes #220 Fixed potential security issue by enabling autoescaping when loading Jinja templates. (Bandit security tool issue B701 ) Thanks to @Pigueiras for his contribution! 2.0.4 \u00b6 Fixed issue with Push Rules when the project name contains a dot. Fixes #224 Fixed calling to process a single subgroup (like: gitlabform 'group/subgroup' ). Fixes #221 2.0.3 \u00b6 Fixed issue with dry-run for Project Push Rules when the current config is empty ( None ). Fixes #223 2.0.2 \u00b6 Fixed issue with unprotect_branch_new_api . Fixes #219 (update: later it turned out that it was not really fixed in 2.0.2 but in 2.0.5 instead) 2.0.1 \u00b6 Fixed issues with Jinja loader. Fixed calls to GitLab API that do not contain 'x-total-pages' header (gradually rolled out since GitLab MR #23931 ). Start showing deprecation warning when using the old branch protection API config syntax. Thanks to @mkjmdski for his contribution! (2.0.0post1-3 release is technically the same as 2.0.1 but was incorrectly versioned.) 2.0.0 \u00b6 (For a detailed info about changes in each RC of v2 please see the previous version of this changelog.) Make deep merging of configuration actually work (breaking change). Fixes #197 (RC5) Introduce config versioning (breaking change). ...or rather a change to avoid breakage. New major releases of GitLabForm starting with v2 will look for config_version key in the config file. If it doesn't exist, or the version does not match expected then the app will exit to avoid applying unexpected configuration and allowing the user to update the configuration. (RC1) New config syntax (breaking change). All 3 levels under a common key projects_and_groups . It should contain a dict, where common config is under a special \"*\" key, group configs under keys like group/* and project configs under keys like group/project . This will allow introducing pattern matching in these keys and introducing support for multiple config files in the future releases. Partially implements #138 . (RC1) Exit with code != 0 when any group/project processing was failed (breaking change). This will allow you to notice problems when running the app from CI. Note that you can restore the old behaviour by running the app with (...) || true . Also standardized exit codes. Exit with 1 in case of input error (f.e. config file does not exist), with 2 in case of processing error (f.e. GitLab returns HTTP 500).Fixes #153 . (RC1) Allow any case in groups and projects names (breaking change). GitLab groups and projects names are case sensitive but you cannot create such entities that differ only in the case. There is also a distinction between a \"name\" and a \"path\" and they may differ in case... To make work with this easier GitLabForm now accepts any case for them in both config files as well as when provided as command line arguments. We also disallow such entities that differ only in case (f.e. group/* and GROUP/* ) to avoid ambiguity. Fixes #160 . (RC2) Ignore archived projects by default (breaking change). This makes processing faster and output shorter. You can restore the previous behavior by adding --include-archived-projects / -a command line switch. Note that you have to do it if you want to unarchive archived projects! Fixes #157 in (arguably) a more convenient way. (RC2) Color output! Implements #141 . (RC1) Add diffing feature for secret variables. (with values shown as hashes to protect the secrets from leaking). (RC6) Added checking for invalid syntax in \"members\" section. Defining groups or users directly under this key instead of under sub-keys \"users\" and \"groups\" will now trigger an immediate error. (RC5) Add support for Python 3.9 (RC8) Added Windows support. Fixes #206 (RC5) Start processing at any group using the new command line switch - --start-from-group / -sfg . Similar to --start-from / -sf switch that can be used for projects. (RC1) Start releasing pre-releases as Docker images. They have tags with specific versions, but not \"latest\" tag as it is reserved for new final releases. Implements #201 (RC5) Prevent multiple email notifications from being sent when adding members to project. Fixes #101 (RC6) Prevent project's Audit Events being filled in with \"Added protected branch\". Fixes #178 (RC6) Fixed using \"expires_at\" for users. Fixes #207 (RC6) Remove the need to add the gitlab.api_version configuration key. (RC1) For Contributors Make writing tests easier and the tests more robust. Deduplicate a lot of the boilerplate code, allow putting configs into the test methods and use pytest fixtures for easier setup and cleanup. This should fix issues with tests reported in #190 . Also stop storing any dockerized GitLab data permanently to avoid problems like #196 and probably other related to failed dockerized GitLab upgrades. (RC3) For Contributors Rename \"integration tests\" to \"acceptance tests\". Because they ARE in fact acceptance tests.

Make deep merging of configuration actually work (breaking change). Fixes #197 (RC5) Introduce config versioning (breaking change). ...or rather a change to avoid breakage. New major releases of GitLabForm starting with v2 will look for config_version key in the config file. If it doesn't exist, or the version does not match expected then the app will exit to avoid applying unexpected configuration and allowing the user to update the configuration. (RC1) New config syntax (breaking change). All 3 levels under a common key projects_and_groups . It should contain a dict, where common config is under a special \"*\" key, group configs under keys like group/* and project configs under keys like group/project . This will allow introducing pattern matching in these keys and introducing support for multiple config files in the future releases. Partially implements #138 . (RC1) Exit with code != 0 when any group/project processing was failed (breaking change). This will allow you to notice problems when running the app from CI. Note that you can restore the old behaviour by running the app with (...) || true . Also standardized exit codes. Exit with 1 in case of input error (f.e. config file does not exist), with 2 in case of processing error (f.e. GitLab returns HTTP 500).Fixes #153 . (RC1) Allow any case in groups and projects names (breaking change). GitLab groups and projects names are case sensitive but you cannot create such entities that differ only in the case. There is also a distinction between a \"name\" and a \"path\" and they may differ in case... To make work with this easier GitLabForm now accepts any case for them in both config files as well as when provided as command line arguments. We also disallow such entities that differ only in case (f.e. group/* and GROUP/* ) to avoid ambiguity. Fixes #160 . (RC2) Ignore archived projects by default (breaking change). This makes processing faster and output shorter. You can restore the previous behavior by adding --include-archived-projects / -a command line switch. Note that you have to do it if you want to unarchive archived projects! Fixes #157 in (arguably) a more convenient way. (RC2) Color output! Implements #141 . (RC1) Add diffing feature for secret variables. (with values shown as hashes to protect the secrets from leaking). (RC6) Added checking for invalid syntax in \"members\" section. Defining groups or users directly under this key instead of under sub-keys \"users\" and \"groups\" will now trigger an immediate error. (RC5) Add support for Python 3.9 (RC8) Added Windows support. Fixes #206 (RC5) Start processing at any group using the new command line switch - --start-from-group / -sfg . Similar to --start-from / -sf switch that can be used for projects. (RC1) Start releasing pre-releases as Docker images. They have tags with specific versions, but not \"latest\" tag as it is reserved for new final releases. Implements #201 (RC5) Prevent multiple email notifications from being sent when adding members to project. Fixes #101 (RC6) Prevent project's Audit Events being filled in with \"Added protected branch\". Fixes #178 (RC6) Fixed using \"expires_at\" for users. Fixes #207 (RC6) Remove the need to add the gitlab.api_version configuration key. (RC1) For Contributors Make writing tests easier and the tests more robust. Deduplicate a lot of the boilerplate code, allow putting configs into the test methods and use pytest fixtures for easier setup and cleanup. This should fix issues with tests reported in #190 . Also stop storing any dockerized GitLab data permanently to avoid problems like #196 and probably other related to failed dockerized GitLab upgrades. (RC3) For Contributors Rename \"integration tests\" to \"acceptance tests\". Because they ARE in fact acceptance tests.

This is where we borrowed from the concept of a hierarchical configuration that is inherited from the higher to the lower levers while you also can override some config parts on the lower levels. Example 1 - configuration inheritance & overriding \u00b6 You want to configure all your GitLab instance projects to have JIRA integration enabled for your MRs to have ticket ids shown as links to JIRA in the web UI, but you DON'T want the integration that enables to close JIRA tickets from MRs that have \"closes \" in their description, so you do this: projects_and_groups : # common settings for ALL projects in ALL groups \"*\" : services : jira : url : https://jira.yourcompany.com commit_events : false merge_requests_events : true username : fake # this field is required by the GitLab API, but you can set it to any value password : fake # this field is required by the GitLab API, but you can set it to any value ...but you DO want this feature for a group of projects, but without comments about each commit added to JIRA, so then you add this to your config: # settings for ALL projects in 'some_group_name' group some_group_name/* : services : jira : username : real_username password : real_password jira_issue_transition_id : 123 ...and finally you realize that for a single project in that group you also DO WANT those comments (for example for compliance reasons), so you add: # settings for a single project some_group_name/specific_project_name : services : jira : commit_events : true Note how you don't have to provide a full config each time - only the parts that are changing. This is because the configs from the higher level are being merged with the ones on the lower. Example 2 - adding elements \u00b6 You want to add a default README file to all your projects that contains a convenience link to search for given project in Confluence. So you add this to your config: projects_and_groups : \"*\" : files : \"README.md\" : overwrite : false # do not overwrite if someone already added a real README only_first_branch : true # add the file only to the first branch in the below list branches : - develop - main skip_ci : true # this will prevent the commit that applies this file change triggering CI build content : | This is a default project README. Please replace it with a proper one! Search for this project in Confluence with this [link](https://confluence.yourcompany.com/dosearchsite.action?cql=siteSearch%20~%20%22{{ project }}%22&includeArchivedSpaces=false). Then you realize that for \"app_1\" group projects you also want to add a default .gitignore file, so you add this to your config: app_1/* : files : \".gitignore\" : overwrite : false only_first_branch : true branches : - develop - main skip_ci : true content : | *.swp *.bak Note that the projects in the group \"app_1\" will have BOTH files added - README.md and .gitignore . This is because the configs are additive for most \"listed\" elements. (Note that you can disable additivity selectively by using skip: true configuration expression, like this: app_1/some_repo : files : \".gitignore\" : skip : true # thanks to this `app_1/some_repo` will NOT get `.gitignore` file from GitLabForm ) Raw parameters passing \u00b6 Since 2017, when GitLabForm was originally developed, GitLab development pace is so fast that we are not able to keep up with it by updating GitLabForm whenever a parameter is added or changed in the GitLab's API. Because of that we made a decision to use \"raw parameters passing\" - for many configuration elements whatever you put inside it as a dict, will be sent with a PUT/POST request into the appropriate GitLab API as-is. The advantage of this approach is that you can use each of the +40 parameters from the GitLab API for Projects to configure your project with GitLabForm and when GitLab adds a new parameter there you can start using it on the day you update your GitLab instance, without waiting for GitLabForm to be updated to support it. Similarly for the Group settings, using +20 parameters from the GitLab API for Groups .

Project Structure \u00b6 Packages \u00b6 gitlabform.* and gitlabform.processors.* - contains the main app logic.

Common pattern - multiple inheritance \u00b6 In many of the above packages we are using multiple inheritance . The basic features are implemented in the \"core\" class defined in core.py . Extensions to it are defined in all other files as \"feature\" classes that inherit the \"core\". Finally, there is an \"everything\" class that groups them all - it is defined in the __init__.py file. gitlabform. and gitlabform.processors. \u00b6 The entry point for running the app is in run.py and the main logic is in the GitLabForm class. This code boils down to the run() method, which for each project that according to the app parameters and config should be taken into account, applies the effective config. The effective config contains what is called the \"config sections\", which are the YAML keys that can exist under projects in the config YAML, for example: deploy_keys , secret_variables , group_secret_variables and so on. Those config sections are processed by the code in the classes inheriting from the AbstractProcessor class. This class should be reused when implementing new functionalities (such as supporting new configuration keys) as it holds the common logic for skipping the configuration parts and running in dry-run mode. The processors have been grouped into two packages - group where the processors applied to the group settings are implemented and project - where processors executed on the project level are located. Since v2.2.0 there is a new way of implementing processors - by inheriting form MultipleEntitiesProcessor class. It should be applied for new features which manage 0-N entities of some kind under a group or a project. See BadgesProcessor as an example how to use it. Since v2.10.0 we have a similar solution for features where you manage a single entity - SingleEntityProcessor class. See ProjectPushRulesProcessor as an example how to use it. Usage \u00b6 If you want to add/change/fix things under an existing config section then most likely you will need to update the code in the processor classes (for example, in BranchesProcessor ). If you want to add support for a new config section (= completely new feature), then you need to: (TODO: expand this sections) Consider writing a new processor using MultipleEntitiesProcessor class as a base. Create a new class group_<new_config_section_name>_processor (if it applies to the group settings) or <new_config_section_name>_processor (if it applies to project settings) and implement two methods: _process_configuration - which does the actual processing by calling the API and applying the changes in GitLab; _log_changes - which is optional but recommended to implement; by calling this method the effective changes to be applied should be logged (when running in dry-run mode). Add the new processor to GroupProcessors in group > __init__.py (if group settings processor was created) or to ProjectProcessors in project > __init__.py . gitlabform.gitlab.* \u00b6 With the basics for making requests to the GitLab API covered in the GitLabCore class in core.py , all other code is simple (most of the time). Almost all methods in other classes end up calling self._make_requests_to_api , which takes care of making the HTTP GitLab API requests with proper authentication, pagination, retries, timeouts and more. Sometimes there is some logic in these methods if: we only need a specific part of the response from GitLab API - see GitLabProjects.get_all_projects() as an example, some GitLab APIs need some workarounds for their bugs or documentation inconsistencies, like: some APIs declare in the docs that they accept both \"group/project\" string OR a project id while in fact only the latter works - see GitLabProjects.post_approvals() as an example, some APIs return invalid HTTP error codes, like 404 instead of 400 - see GitLabGroupLDAPLinks.add_ldap_group_link as an example.

This will make the following script use it to be able to test Premium (paid) features. Of course this license will not leave your machine. Run below commands to start GitLab in a container. Note that it may take a few minutes! ./dev/run_gitlab_in_docker.sh Run pytest tests/acceptance to start all tests. To run only a single class with tests run f.e. py.test tests/acceptance -k \"TestArchiveProject\" . Running acceptance tests using your own GitLab instance \u00b6 Note : GitLabForm acceptance tests operate own their own groups, projects and users and it should be safe to run them on any GitLab instance. However we do not take any responsibility for it. Please review the code to ensure what it does and run it at your own risk! Get an admin user API token and put it into GITLAB_TOKEN env variable. Do the same with your GitLab instance URL and GITLAB_URL : export GITLAB_URL=\"https://mygitlab.company.com\" export GITLAB_TOKEN=\"<my admin user API token>\" Run pytest tests/acceptance to start all tests To run only a single class with tests run f.e. py.test tests/acceptance -k \"TestArchiveProject\" .
